            Powering the 2022 Jaguar XF is the same turbocharged 2.0-Litre four-cylinder engine, which comes in two
            states of tune. The P50 version of the XF produces 246 HP, whereas the P300 makes around 296 HP. The
            base-level engine is fairly solid, but for those looking for an extra punch, the P300 is a fabulous choice.

        <p class="lead font-weight-bold">
            The XF overflows with English luxury charm, even if it isn't as well-rounded as some of its competitors. Its
            simple, elegant sheet metal and sporty stance fit a Jaguar. With the latest updates, the cabin is better
            than ever.

            The interior of the XF is finely built and features loads of soft-touch materials and leather. The vehicle
            has ample knee room, headroom, and shoulder room for a vehicle in its class. It has a wheelbase of 116.5
            inches while allowing the XF to seat 5 in comfort

            It has sophisticated Jaguar-like styling, packs in good performance numbers, and is convenient. The car is
            inspired by the F-type sports car, and for 2022, the F-Pace has received a minor facelift over the previous
            generation on the outside and the inside
